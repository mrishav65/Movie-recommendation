# Movie-recommendation
An intelligent chatbot that recommends movies based on natural language queries using NLP (spaCy) and Streamlit.
This chatbot understands user queries like:

“Show me some action movies”

“Recommend movies by Christopher Nolan”

“Find films after 2010”

“Movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio”

“Rating above 8”

It uses a movie dataset (movies.csv) and processes your input through spaCy NLP to detect intent — then returns the top-rated results interactively in a clean Streamlit web interface.
